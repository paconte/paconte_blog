At my current job we are using Scala and Python. We decided to use the
buildern pattern for one of the python microservices. While writing
the buildern pattern in python, I realized how the scala team
tried to use the same scala/java habbit to Python. Lets see the
differences.

While python supports function default arguments [fn:1] and named
parameters [fn:2], Java doesn't. However Java supports function
overloading [fn:3] and python not.

[fn:3] The lin is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading
