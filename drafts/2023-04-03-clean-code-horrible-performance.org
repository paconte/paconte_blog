#+description: Clean code vs performance, a big missunderstanding.

Today I would like to talk about a youtube video from Molly Rocket
called [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD5NrevFtbU]["Clean" Code, Horrible Performance]],
in the video the author explains and demonstrates how bad performant
clean code is, he takes an example from the clean code book and removes
some rules which contribute to make your code "clean". It does it by
removing one rule at a time and measuring the performance gained. The
final "unclean" code is over 20 times faster than the "clean" code.

While discussing the video, I realized the conversation became quickly
emotional and generated some controversy, at some moment I was asked
about my opinion but before revealing it I would like to recall some
concepts.
